# Performance

The following perfomance estimates are very approximate, but were calulcated from on sky data.

Zeropoints (1 e-/s): 20.55 (B), 20.8 (V), 20.9 (R)

Dark sky brightness @ airmass ~ 1.35: 6 e-/s/pix (B), 18 e-/s/pix (V), 21 e-/s/pix (R)
Dark sky brightness @ airmass ~ 1.35: 17.5 mag/arcsec^2 (B), 16.6 mag/arcsec^2 (V), 16.5 mag/arcsec^2 (R)
Readout noise: 18 e-/pix
Dark current: 1 e-/s/pix (-20C), 3 e-/s/pix (-5C)
Extinction coefficients: 0.5 mag/airmass (B), 0.2 mag/airmass (V), 0.2 mag/airmass (R) - very approximate

Astrometry: ~0.1" precision achieved previously
