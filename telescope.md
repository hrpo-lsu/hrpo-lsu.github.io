# Performance

The following perfomance estimates are very approximate, but were calulcated from on sky data.

|Filter|B|V|R
|-|-|-|-
|Zeropoints (1 e-/s) | 20.55 | 20.8* | 20.9 
|Dark sky brightness @ airmass ~ 1.35 | 6 e-/s/pix | 18 e-/s/pix | 21 e-/s/pix 
|Dark sky brightness @ airmass ~ 1.35 | 17.5 mag/arcsec^2 | 16.6 mag/arcsec^2 | 16.5 mag/arcsec^2 
|Readout noise | 18 e-/pix ||
|Dark current  | 1 e-/s/pix (-20C), 3 e-/s/pix (-5C) ||
|Extinction coefficients (very approximate) | 0.5 mag/airmass | 0.2 mag/airmass | 0.2 mag/airmass 
|Astrometry  | ~0.1" precision ||
*In principle this should be ~24.
