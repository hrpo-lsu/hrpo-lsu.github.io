## For Observers
Website for Highland Road Park Observatory time allocation and observatory user information. This page will collect various documents and how-to guides for the observatory.

### Planning your observations

[Observing Request Form]() - a template form to provide other observers the information necessary for them to gather the data that you need.

[Alta E47+ CCD Camera Data Sheet]()

[Swarthmore Finder Chart Tool](https://astro.swarthmore.edu/transits/finding_charts.cgi) I recommend it covering 15'x15', with a 11'x11' box; you'll need to rotate them by 180 degrees for the 20" telescope)

### Tips for Observing & Requesting Observations

- Requests: No exposures longer than 60 seconds – if you need more exposure, request multiple exposures and add dithers of ~10 arcsec to 1 arcmin
- Requests: Think about whether you need data in all three filters, or will just one or two do? You need a lot of exposure time to get good B data, and its nearly impossible with a full moon
- Requests: Please make the finder charts 15x15 arcmin to be readable, and rotate them by 180 degrees.
- Observing: Don’t try to correct other’s instructions – call them over if you think there’s a problem/you don’t understand what they want.
- Observing: Don’t take too long trying to get observations right – there’s usually a lot to get through, and time spent on a hard target that might not be possible means a target more likely to be successfully observed is missed. Give feedback in the night report if unsuccessful.
- Observing: Be careful when entering coordinates into the telescope – make sure the epoch is set to J2000, not current.
